The Beatles, english old boys, had hairs like mop and a good singing mouth.	君	しょくん【諸君】Gentlemen!; Ladies!<br/>さいくん【細君】one's wife (when speaking with a close friend) / your wife (when speaking with a junior)<br/>きみたち【君たち】(used colloquially by young females) you (plural); all of you; you all<br/>ひめぎみ【姫君】daughter of a person of high rank (i.e. a king, noble, aristocrat, etc.)<br/>しゅくん【主君】lord; master<br/>きんだち【公達】kings; children of nobles; young nobleman<br/>きみたち【君たち】(used colloquially by young females) you (plural); all of you; you all<br/>くんしゅ【君主】ruler; monarch; sovereign<br/>わかぎみ【若君】young lord or prince<br/>めぎみ【女君】someone else's daughter / one's wife<br/>くんりん【君臨】reigning; controlling / to reign; to dictate; to control<br/>くんし【君子】man of virtue; person of high rank; wise man<br/>ふくん; ちちぎみ【父君】father<br/>ぼうくん【暴君】tyrant; despot<br/>めいくん【名君】wise ruler; enlightened monarch; benevolent lord<br/>きくん【貴君】you (primarily used by men in letters to their equals or inferiors)<br/>たいくん【大君】liege lord; shogunate<br/>おおきみ; おおぎみ【大君】emperor; king; prince<br/>めいくん【名君】wise ruler; enlightened monarch; benevolent lord<br/>くんしん【君臣】ruler and ruled; master and servant	31	クン	きみ, -ぎみ	1162	285	2	[sound:RTK1_keyword_jp_1246..mp3]	[sound:RTK1_keyword_en_1246.mp3]

I spent $100 recently on this excellent rust-proof, water-proof, fire-proof comb. But two days after having bought it, I left it in my back pocket and sat down, snapping this expensive comb in half! I glued it back together, but now every time I try to comb through my thick hair, it just breaks apart again.
