Before we start, it is a good idea to keep the key word distinct from <i>melancholy</i> (Frame 663), with which it combines to create the psychological condition of depression (a metaphor based on the hollow or sinking of the material <i>depression</i> we met in Frame 1421).<div>The picture of <b>gloom</b> begins with a small <i>grove</i> of trees, under which we see a <i>crown</i> made out of used <i>tin cans</i>. Next (the lower half of the kanji) we find a combination that appears only a few times in modern characters and only once in those treated in the volumes of <i>Remembering the Kanji</i>. It is composed of a <i>shovel</i> with a <i>sheaf</i> dotted with small <i>drops</i> on all sides. Think of it as a large scoop <i>shovel</i> attached to the front of a bulldozer, whose driver is singing: ♪ ""Bulldozing in the <i>sheaves</i>, bulldozing in the <i>sheaves</i>..."" ♪ The <i>drops</i> represent the chaff flying about as the <i>sheaves</i> are tossed about by the heavy machinery.</div><div>There is <i>someone sitting on the ground</i> alongside, watching as the machinery makes its way around the neighboring farmland - and it´s you, wearing your <i>tin-can crown</i>. You feel overwhelmed by the impending doom as the invasion of agro-business draws closer and closer to the <i>grove</i>, the only patch of woods that remains of what once was a vast forest. The whole scene represents a re-<i>shaping</i> of the natural environment that brings the heavy weight of <b>gloom</b> down upon you.</div><div>A bit much, perhaps, but there are enough elements to allow for any number of other combinations.</div>"		29			鬱	ゆううつ【幽欝】depression; melancholy; dejection; gloom<br/>いんうつ【陰うつ】gloom; melancholy<br/>うっそう【欝蒼】thick; dense; luxuriant<br/>うっぷん【欝憤】resentment; grudge; anger<br/>うつうつ【鬱々】gloomy; melancholy; pessimistic<br/>うこん; ウコン【欝金】turmeric (Curcuma domestica)<br/>ちんうつ【沈鬱】melancholy; gloom; depression<br/>うっせき【欝積】accumulation (e.g. of emotions, grievances, etc.); buildup; suppression (e.g. of anger)<br/>うっとうしい; うっとおしい【鬱陶しい】gloomy (e.g. mood); depressing / irritating; troublesome / heavy (weather); cloudy<br/>うっくつ【鬱屈】gloomy<br/>そううつびょう; そううつやまい【そううつ病】manic depression; manic-depressive psychosis; bipolar disorder<br/>あんうつ【暗うつ】gloom; melancholy<br/>きうつ【気欝】gloom; mental depression<br/>うっけつ【欝血】blood congestion / -stasis<br/>うつびょう【欝病】melancholia; depression<br/>うつぜん【鬱然】dense (vegetation); thick / prominent; popular / gloomy (mood)<br/>そううつ【躁うつ】manic-depressive (bipolar); mood swing<br/>うつぼつ【鬱勃】irresistible force or movement<br/>ふさぐ【鬱ぐ】to feel depressed; to mope<br/>うつうつ【鬱々】gloomy; melancholy; pessimistic	53	ウツ	うっ.する, ふさ.ぐ, しげ.る		2136	0	[sound:RTK1_keyword_jp_2120..mp3]	[sound:RTK1_keyword_en_2120.mp3]

Whatever the parable´s significance for modern civilization and its arsenals, it should help with this kanji. Oh yes, we should not forget that cliff-like element. Think of it as an abbreviation of the primitive for <i>zoo</i> (the first and fourth strokes, actually), in order to fit the <b>tiger</b> somewhere into the picture. In fact, the abbreviation is perfectly logical, since the bottom elements usurp the room for the rest of the primitive for <i>zoo</i>.
