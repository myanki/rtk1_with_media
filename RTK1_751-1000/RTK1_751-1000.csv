It was uncomfortable, though, how your uncle (#718) often touched you just a little above the crotch (叔) when coaching...	淑	しゅくじょ【淑女】lady<br/>ていしゅく【貞淑】chastity; virtue; fidelity; feminine modesty<br/>しとやか【淑やか】graceful; ladylike; modest; gentle; polite; quiet; well-mannered; refined (behavior)<br/>しゅくとく【淑徳】womanly virtues<br/>ししゅく【私淑】adoring; looking up to	23	シュク	しと.やか	721	1530	1	[sound:RTK1_keyword_jp_778..mp3]	[sound:RTK1_keyword_en_778.mp3]

Homer stops to take a leak in a mountain stream but gets snatched by an eagle. Hear his scream?	A husband who went fishing at the mountain stream to feed his family, fell in the rapids (we´ll assume this is a large mountain stream). He is saved from the waters by a great eagle. He comes back home with nothing to feed the family, his clothes still dripping wet as he tells his wife of how he was saved by a great eagle, and of course she does not believe him. The story continues in chicken (#1947).	渓	たに【渓】valley<br/>けいこく【渓谷】valley; ravine; canyon<br/>けいりゅう【渓流】mountain stream; mountain torrent<br/>せっけい【雪渓】snowy valley	25	ケイ	たに, たにがわ	840	1528	1	[sound:RTK1_keyword_jp_903..mp3]	[sound:RTK1_keyword_en_903.mp3]

This character has the special sense of <b>journeying</b> to someplace or other.		8	In Medieval Japan, going to see your lord was often a long journey.	The fellowship of the ring is on a long journey through the depths of Khaz Modan. Imagine they walk through the hall of pillars, with only light being from their own candlesticks that. Soon they will meet much more light than they would ever want to...	往	おうらい【往来】coming and going; traffic / road; street / association; socializing; socialising; fellowship / recurring (e.g. thoughts) / correspondence<br/>おうふく【往復】making a round trip; going and returning; coming and going / round-trip ticket; return ticket / correspondence; exchanging (letters) / socializing; visiting one another<br/>いく; ゆく【往く】to go; to move (in a direction or towards a specific location); to head (towards); to be transported (towards); to reach / to proceed; to take place / to pass through; to come and go / to walk / to die; to pass away / to do (in a specific way) / to stream; to flow / to continue / to have an orgasm; to come; to cum / to trip; to get high; to have a drug-induced hallucination<br/>うおうさおう【右往左往】move about in confusion; go every which way; going right and left; this way and that<br/>おうおう【往々】sometimes; often<br/>おうじょう【往生】death; passing to the next life; dying a happy death / giving up a struggle; submission / at wit's end; flummoxed<br/>おうかん【往還】traffic; coming and going; highway<br/>たちおうじょう【立往生】bring to a standstill; stalling; stranding<br/>おうじょうぎわ【往生際】at the point of death; the time to give up<br/>ゆき; いき【往き】bound for ... / going (to)<br/>おうねん【往年】former; one-time; years ago<br/>おうじ【往時】ancient times<br/>おうしん【往診】doctor's visit; house call<br/>たちおうじょう【立往生】bring to a standstill; stalling; stranding<br/>おうろ【往路】outward journey<br/>いきき; ゆきき【往き来】coming and going; keeping in touch; visiting each other / street traffic; highway<br/>おうせき【往昔】ancient times<br/>むりおうじょう【無理圧状】forcing compliance<br/>ごくらくおうじょう【極楽往生】rebirth in paradise; peaceful death<br/>きおう【既往】the past	25	オウ	い.く, いにしえ, さき.に, ゆ.く	880	652	1	[sound:RTK1_keyword_jp_945..mp3]	[sound:RTK1_keyword_en_945.mp3]

"Suggestion: Replace ""spool"" with ""toilet paper/roll"". Reasons: (1) Toilet paper/roll usually comes on a spool. (2) Toilet paper is used to clean the soil off your crotch. Story: Measure the diameter of a column (maybe Nelson´s Column in London?) using a roll of toilet paper. Spool also appears in stalk (#715), suspicious (#716), lightly (#717), sutra (#1360)."	径	ちょっけい【直径】diameter<br/>こうけい【口径】aperture; bore; calibre; caliber<br/>はんけい【半径】radius<br/>こみち; しょうけい【小径】path; lane / small diameter; small radius<br/>けいろ【径路】course; route; path; channel / process; means<br/>ちょうけい【長径】major axis<br/>ちょくじょうけいこう【直情径行】impulsive and straightforward; guileless<br/>しょうけい【捷径】shortcut; expedient<br/>ないけい【内径】bore; inside diameter<br/>そけい【鼠径】groin; inguinal region	25	ケイ	みち, こみち, さしわたし, ただちに	882	492	1	[sound:RTK1_keyword_jp_947..mp3]	[sound:RTK1_keyword_en_947.mp3]

The he has a column covered in a pelt... a penis. Badum-ching.	The ultimate he-man is the Neanderthal cave man. His club is as big as a pillar (column), and he wears a ragged pelt as his only clothing. To remember the column, imagine the cave man resting the club vertically like a column when not in use.	彼	かれら【彼ら】they (usually male); them<br/>あれら【彼ら】those (indicating something distant from both speaker and listener, or something understood without naming it directly) / they (of people) (used to refer to one's equals or inferiors)<br/>あちら; あっち; あち【彼方】that way (direction distant from both speaker and listener); over there; yonder / that one (something physically distant from both speaker and listener, or something not visible but known by both speaker and listener); that / that person (someone physically distant from both speaker and listener, or someone not present but known by both speaker and listener) / there (place distant from both speaker and listener); over there; foreign country (esp. a Western nation)<br/>かなた; あなた【彼方】beyond; across; the other side; the distance<br/>かのじょら【彼女ら】they (females); them<br/>あいつ; きゃつ; かやつ; あやつ【彼奴】he; she; that guy<br/>かれし【彼氏】boyfriend<br/>あそこ; あすこ; かしこ; あしこ; あこ【彼処】there (place physically distant from both speaker and listener); over there; that place; yonder / genitals / that far (something psychologically distant from both speaker and listener); that much; that point<br/>だれかれ; たれかれ【誰かれ】this or that person; anybody; many people<br/>ひが【彼我】self and others; this and that; both sides; oneself and one's opponent; he and I<br/>ひがん【彼岸】equinoctial week (when Buddhist services are held) / Buddhist services during the equinoctial week / nirvana<br/>あれこれ; かれこれ【彼是】one thing or another; this and that; this or that / just on; around; about; nearly; roughly; almost; round about<br/>あれこれ; かれこれ【彼是】one thing or another; this and that; this or that / just on; around; about; nearly; roughly; almost; round about<br/>ひがんばな; ヒガンバナ【彼岸花】red spider lily (Lycoris radiata); cluster amaryllis<br/>ひがんざくら; ヒガンザクラ【彼岸桜】higan cherry (species of weeping cherry tree, Prunus subhirtella); early-flowering cherry (around the spring equinox) / double weeping rosebud cherry (Prunus pendula)<br/>なにかと【何かと】one way or another<br/>あのよ【あの世】the other world; world of the dead; netherworld<br/>ひがんえ【彼岸会】Buddhist services during the equinoctial week	25	ヒ	かれ, かの, か.の	883	1203	2	[sound:RTK1_keyword_jp_948..mp3]	[sound:RTK1_keyword_en_948.mp3]
